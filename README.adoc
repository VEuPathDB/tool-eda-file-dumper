# EDA File Dumper Tool

A command line tool to read from an EDA database and dump a study's data to a set of binary files.  The files are designed for the https://github.com/VEuPathDB/lib-eda-subsetting[EDA Subsetting Library]'s high-speed file-based map-reduce system.

This repo is templated from https://github.com/VEuPathDB/tool-java-maven-template.  Please the readme there for generic details.
