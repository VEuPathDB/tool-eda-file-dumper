# EDA File Dumper Tool

A command line tool to read from an EDA database and dump a study's data to a set of binary files.  The files are designed for the https://github.com/VEuPathDB/lib-eda-subsetting[EDA Subsetting Library]'s high-speed file-based map-reduce system.

This repo is templated from https://github.com/VEuPathDB/tool-java-maven-template.  Please the readme there for generic details.

# File structure
The file structure produced on output is controlled by link:src/main/java/org/veupathdb/eda/dumper/BinaryFilesManager.java[BinaryFilesManager.java]

```
 studies/                # created externally to this tool
  study_GEMS1A/          # study internal abrev
    DONE                 # an empty file.  written when all files are complete  
    entity_EUPA_12345/   # an entity ID
      ancestors          # ancestor ID indices. (omitted if root)
      DONE               # an empty file.  written when all files are complete
      ids_map            # index -> ID map
      meta.json          # info describing the files, used for decoding
      var_EUPA_44444     # a variable file
      var_EUPA_55555     # another variable file
      vocab_EUPA_55555   # a vocabulary file
   [more entities here...]
```
### Sample meta.json
```
{
  "numAncestors" = 5,
  "var_EUPA_4444" = "INTEGER",
  "var_EUPA_6666" = "DATE"
}
```
Supported variable types are `INTEGER`, `DATE`, `NUMBER`.  (String vocabularies are encoded as `INTEGER` because they contain the index into the vocabulary)
